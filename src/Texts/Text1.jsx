            <p>

                Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her life, but
                really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So Lucy felt, or
                strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which
                wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more
                beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the
                largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen
                to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not
                like it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Lucy was bewildered.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an
                obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in my small
                way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a
                sort that they will not presume on this.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger
                and unsuspected issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she
                wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she
                reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air,
                thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in
                the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines,
                black against the rising moon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door,
                and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and
                whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was then that she
                saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an
                enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of
                a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious,
                portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but
                fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the
                property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between
                two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him. Then she completed her
                inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.

                    Chapter I<br/>
                    The Bertolini</h2>
                <p>
                    “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at
                    all. She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which
                    here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart. Oh,
                    Lucy!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the
                    Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at the two rows
                    of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of
                    water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the
                    portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the
                    English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
                    Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
                    “Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly
                    believe that all kinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s
                    being so tired.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her
                    fork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter
                    would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to do it at all.
                    Oh, it is a shame!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that
                    you shouldn’t have a view.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of
                    course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first vacant room
                    in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose
                    travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to
                    which she made many a tactful allusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, no. You must have it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “She would never forgive <i>me</i>.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a
                    little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they
                    wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of
                    them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant
                    forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He said:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I have a view, I have a view.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them over for
                    a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do”
                    till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she
                    glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and
                    large eyes. There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the
                    childishness of senility. What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to
                    consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her.
                    He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the
                    swim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A
                    view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view too.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have
                    yours. We’ll change.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the
                    new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible,
                    and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again repressed
                    her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he
                    thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying,
                    “George, persuade them!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s nothing
                    else to say.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and
                    sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is
                    known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these
                    ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not
                    with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different,
                    whose existence she had not realized before. Now the old man attacked Miss
                    Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change? What possible objection
                    had she? They would clear out in half an hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless
                    in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any one so gross. Her
                    face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as much as to say, “Are you
                    all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the
                    table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly
                    indicating “We are not; we are genteel.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat
                    that she had once censured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will make a
                    change.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The curtains
                    at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive,
                    who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for
                    his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet,
                    exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr. Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh,
                    Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are. Oh!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett
                    and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of
                    St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies
                    quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward pleasantly enough
                    and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I <i>am</i> so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of
                    spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin
                    had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer Street, too, makes
                    it so specially funny.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett,
                    filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation
                    that you have just accepted the living—”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you at
                    Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe is—’”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer Street
                    next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get
                    him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss
                    Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the girl whether she
                    knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been
                    there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the
                    field. “Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded. “The first fine
                    afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that
                    sort.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are wrong. The
                    first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We are in
                    luck.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People told them
                    what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of
                    the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would
                    grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically,
                    that they would do. Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted
                    at them. And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They
                    must go to Prato. That place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I
                    revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned
                    moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do. Lucy, in the
                    midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave her no extra
                    pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she
                    turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by
                    raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the
                    curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more
                    than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to
                    her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her
                    daughter. It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey
                    the grace and geniality of the South. And even more curious was the
                    drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury
                    boarding-house. Was this really Italy?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the
                    colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she
                    spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as
                    though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to
                    you,” she was saying. “The first evening means so much. When you arrived we
                    were in for a peculiarly <i>mauvais quart d’heure</i>.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He expressed his regret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at
                    dinner?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Emerson.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Is he a friend of yours?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Then I will say no more.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and
                    it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom
                    we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate. I hope I acted for the
                    best.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a few
                    moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of
                    accepting.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No <i>harm</i>, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I
                    think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show
                    gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he
                    means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them. He
                    no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being
                    polite. It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to
                    understand people who speak the truth.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope
                    that people will be nice.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every point of
                    any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
                    But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When he first came
                    here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no tact and no
                    manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will
                    not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him to our
                    depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the
                    lips.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a nice
                    creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his father’s
                    mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have
                    accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got
                    up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why didn’t
                    you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I haven’t
                    monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all
                    dinner-time.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see good in
                    everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “My dear Lucia—”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr.
                    Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will approve
                    of Mr. Beebe.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world. I
                    am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of
                    herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of
                    the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine. She tried to
                    locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss Bartlett sedulously denied
                    disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very
                    depressing companion.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more
                    careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling
                    very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where
                    Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy,
                    the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the
                    improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room
                    windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
                    She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of
                    attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was
                    proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real
                    catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had
                    found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better
                    than something else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so English.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson was more
                    tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think he was meaning to be kind.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of course, I was
                    holding back on my cousin’s account.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be
                    too careful with a young girl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No one was
                    careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have
                    you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate,
                    and yet at the same time—beautiful?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty and
                    delicacy the same?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are so
                    difficult, I sometimes think.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking
                    extremely pleasant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so glad. Mr.
                    Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I
                    encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me come and ask you. He
                    would be so pleased.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now. The old
                    man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett was silent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I must
                    apologize for my interference.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My
                    own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours. It would be
                    hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only
                    here through your kindness. If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their
                    rooms, I will do it. Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I
                    accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank
                    him personally?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and
                    silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The clergyman, inwardly cursing the
                    female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the acceptance to
                    come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so
                    low were their chairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally. But
                    any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes
                    out.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came forth
                    wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of
                    Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do to keep
                    polite.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then looking
                    rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write
                    up his philosophic diary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of
                    heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—”
                    Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation
                    developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal
                    part. Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature. Taking up
                    Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most
                    important dates of Florentine History. For she was determined to enjoy herself
                    on the morrow. Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss
                    Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will superintend the
                    move.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But I would like to help you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, dear.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her life, but
                    really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So Lucy felt, or
                    strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which
                    wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more
                    beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the
                    largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen
                    to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not
                    like it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy was bewildered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an
                    obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in my small
                    way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a
                    sort that they will not presume on this.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger
                    and unsuspected issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she
                    wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she
                    reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air,
                    thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in
                    the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines,
                    black against the rising moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door,
                    and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and
                    whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was then that she
                    saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an
                    enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of
                    a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious,
                    portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but
                    fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the
                    property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between
                    two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him. Then she completed her
                    inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.

                    Chapter II<br/>
                    In Santa Croce with No Baedeker</h2>
                <p>
                    It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare
                    room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a
                    painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of
                    yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows,
                    pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with
                    beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the
                    Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore,
                    and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
                    An electric tram came rushing underneath the window. No one was inside it,
                    except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who
                    preferred to stand. Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with
                    no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go. Then soldiers
                    appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack
                    covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger
                    soldier. Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before
                    them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar
                    became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in
                    a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came
                    out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man
                    who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the
                    traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the
                    corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and
                    the men and women who live under it. So it was as well that Miss Bartlett
                    should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door
                    unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed,
                    should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone. By the
                    time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the
                    clever lady among the crumbs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was, after
                    all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling
                    in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy would rather like to go out,
                    as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone. Miss
                    Bartlett could not allow this. Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
                    Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never
                    do. Oh, yes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point the clever lady broke in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can
                    neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly
                    safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two
                    daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them
                    go in sailor-hats instead. Every one takes them for English, you see,
                    especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
                    She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad. The
                    clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa
                    Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring
                    me luck, we shall have an adventure.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see
                    where Santa Croce was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker. He
                    does but touch the surface of things. As to the true Italy—he does not
                    even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started
                    with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last. The Cockney
                    Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right
                    along the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the side
                    streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle Grazie—particularly
                    interesting, mentioned by Dante. San Miniato—beautiful as well as
                    interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would
                    remember the story. The men on the river were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is
                    most information.) Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white
                    bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has its own
                    smell.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a
                    distaste to dirt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
                    Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at that adorable
                    wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short,
                    fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace. It was a
                    treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue
                    military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of
                    festivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent
                    of a little civility to your inferiors. <i>That</i> is the true democracy.
                    Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re shocked.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out. My
                    father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical
                    again now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our front
                    door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother
                    says nonsense, a tramp.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over the
                    Weald.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very nicest
                    people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Very well indeed.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have
                    property in Surrey?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty
                    acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s
                    Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last name of Lady
                    Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but
                    she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And just as Miss Lavish had got the
                    name, she broke off and exclaimed:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of
                    which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But Miss Lavish had
                    said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her
                    with no misgivings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a
                    wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us! What are we to
                    do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is what <i>I</i> call an
                    adventure.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that
                    they should ask the way there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, <i>not</i> to
                    look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We will simply
                    drift.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither
                    commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
                    Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became
                    discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy appeared. She stood in the
                    Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies
                    whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale. There they stood, with their shining
                    limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms
                    extended against circlets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything
                    more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward,
                    declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather
                    ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little
                    shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of the paper in which it
                    was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown. But it gave them
                    strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of
                    which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke
                    to it dramatically. It was Santa Croce. The adventure was over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them. I
                    do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into the church, too.
                    Oh, the Britisher abroad!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their rooms.
                    They were so very kind.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my Italy like
                    a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination
                    paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What would you ask us?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she,
                    at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood they reached the
                    steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped,
                    squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in
                    the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white
                    whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The beggars
                    worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl
                    ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly into the Piazza with
                    the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original. But
                    at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared
                    down a side street, both gesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to
                    Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had
                    taken her Baedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way
                    about in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in
                    Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a
                    woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
                    Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember
                    whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must
                    be a wonderful building. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it
                    contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was
                    capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her which they were?
                    She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of
                    uncertain authorship or date. There was no one even to tell her which, of all
                    the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was
                    really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring
                    information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the Italian
                    notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the
                    church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out
                    of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
                    She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold
                    was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three
                    Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by
                    sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli
                    memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it very slowly and from
                    immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their
                    handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated. What could this mean? They
                    did it again and again. Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli
                    for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The
                    smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by
                    Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
                    Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell heavily
                    upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted
                    forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the sunshine, little
                    boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
                    Intolerable bishop!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who
                    picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be
                    superstitious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and
                    frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr. Emerson and
                    Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an Italian lady, who
                    ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue. By some mysterious
                    virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone
                    and imparted strength to his knees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation,
                    he walked away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than all the
                    relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make
                    their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of the universe—”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He paused for a phrase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was determined
                    to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to
                    erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant
                    rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what are you
                    doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the church?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss Lavish, who
                    was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she
                    simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young
                    lady for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s <i>that</i> you minded. It’s worth
                    minding, the loss of a Baedeker. <i>That’s</i> worth minding.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure
                    whither it would lead her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where
                    the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not suppose
                    that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the child, and to
                    thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night. I hope that you have
                    not been put to any great inconvenience.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you
                    have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not
                    really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you
                    want to see. To take you to it will be a real pleasure.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious. But
                    it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other
                    times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr. Emerson was an old man, and
                    surely a girl might humour him. On the other hand, his son was a young man, and
                    she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be
                    offended before him. It was at him that she gazed before replying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will
                    kindly tell me which they are.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the
                    Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt like a
                    child in school who had answered a question rightly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them
                    rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by
                    tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it
                    was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the
                    Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now,
                    unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy
                    and perspective. Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful,
                    true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a
                    man who truly feels!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church. “Remember
                    nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means the workmen
                    weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them. Look at
                    that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into
                    the sky like an air balloon.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the
                    lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted uneasily, and
                    so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had
                    cast a spell over her. They were so serious and so strange that she could not
                    remember how to behave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    George replied:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to heaven
                    by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my
                    friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie at
                    peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our
                    work survives.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is,
                    going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at all.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two
                    parties. We will incommode you no longer.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they
                    held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They filed out of the
                    chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension
                    Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The procession disappeared without a word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St.
                    Francis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I don’t
                    remember.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr. Eager.
                    Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go and say we are
                    sorry. Hadn’t I better? Then perhaps he will come back.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He will not come back,” said George.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
                    Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture
                    again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt,
                    injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every little contretemps as
                    if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He will try
                    to be kind.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people because
                    he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think
                    that a kind action done tactfully—”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Tact!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong answer. She
                    watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel. For a young man his
                    face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
                    Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again at Rome, on the
                    ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns. Healthy and
                    muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only
                    find solution in the night. The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have
                    entertained anything so subtle. Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it
                    passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid
                    talk, which was alone familiar to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They won’t
                    come back.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of
                    the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating
                    round the partition wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at those
                    saints?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone that is
                    praised in Ruskin?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it. George, rather
                    to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not
                    unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested
                    many beautiful things inside its walls. There were also beggars to avoid and
                    guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and
                    there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists. But
                    Mr. Emerson was only half interested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he
                    believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about his
                    tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the whole of
                    Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy again felt that this did not do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to give
                    him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition
                    and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God. With such
                    an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as
                    well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother might not like
                    her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most
                    strongly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday to Italy,
                    and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been
                    playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What did you say?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Now don’t be stupid over this. I don’t require you to fall in love with my
                    boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are nearer his age,
                    and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible. You might help me. He
                    has known so few women, and you have the time. You stop here several weeks, I
                    suppose? But let yourself go. You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge
                    from last night. Let yourself go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that
                    you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning
                    of them. By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will
                    be good for both of you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The old trouble; things won’t fit.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What things?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don’t.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he
                    said:
                </p>
                <p className="poem">
                    “‘From far, from eve and morning,<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yon twelve-winded sky,<br/>
                    The stuff of life to knit me<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew hither: here am I’
                </p>
                <p className="noindent">
                    George and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that we come
                    from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a
                    knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But why should this make
                    us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice. I don’t
                    believe in this world sorrow.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Honeychurch assented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of the
                    everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy because
                    the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or
                    something!
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m very sorry,” she cried. “You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—”
                    Then she became matronly. “Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no
                    particular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them
                    at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother. Perhaps
                    Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand. This did
                    not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was
                    thanking her for it. Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him
                    as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as
                    they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker. The dear
                    George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and
                    absurd. He approached, his face in the shadow. He said:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Miss Bartlett.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the
                    whole of life in a new perspective. “Where? Where?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In the nave.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked
                    herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson. “Poor girl!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think myself a
                    very fortunate girl, I assure you. I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid
                    time. Pray don’t waste time mourning over <i>me</i>. There’s enough sorrow in
                    the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it. Good-bye. Thank you both
                    so much for all your kindness. Ah, yes! there does come my cousin. A delightful
                    morning! Santa Croce is a wonderful church.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She joined her cousin.
